# Scripts_for_papers
I am sharing here the code to reproduce my papers. One can use them to directly obtain most of the results and figures in a given article, with the exception of those requiring the use of external software not created by me. Some of the software used to implement the methods I developed is not included here (although the code here does implement those functions, the code released separately is easier to use). Maybe not all code has enough notes, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at lucas.linxuan.li@gmail.com or lli7@caltech.edu (Linxuan Li).
