# Scripts_for_papers
I am sharing the code to reproduce my papers here. One can use them to directly get most of the results and figures in a particular paper, except those using external software which were not written by me. Some of the software used to implement methods I developed are not included here (although the code here does implement those functions, the code released separately is easier to use). Maybe not every code has enough notes, and feel free to contact me with any questions at lucas.linxuan.li@gmail.com or lli7@caltech.edu (Linxuan Li).
