This is a repository containing the code to generate the results in the paper **"Temporal variations in low-frequency Rayleigh-wave velocities should mostly originate from the shallow crust"**, by *Linxuan Li1, Jiangtao Li1, and Xiaodong Song*.

**Data files:**

"Bao_TP_input.txt" and "Bao_BB_input.txt": S velocity models

"Bao_TP_sensitivity.txt" and "Bao_BB_sensitivity.txt": the computed sensitivity kernels (K_V)


**Main scripts:**

"velocity_KV.m" is used to plot Figures 1a and 1b.

"eta_Ksigma.m" is used to plot Figures 1c and 1d.

"nominal_eta" is used to plot Figure 3.

"z_h.m" is used to plot Figures 4 and 5.

**Folder "Lab"**

Contains the the scripts and original data (.xlsx) for reproducing Figure 2. One can use ./(Un)Conolidated_Lab/Out_sensitivity/(un)consolidated_plot to generate Figure 2.
