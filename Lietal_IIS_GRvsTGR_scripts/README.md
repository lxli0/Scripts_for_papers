This is a repository containing the code to generate the results in the paper **"Tapering of large-magnitude events in induced earthquake sequences"**, by *Linxuan Li, Kyungjae Im, and Jean-Philippe Avouac*.

We provide here the scripts used to reproduce all of our figures, except for Extended Data Fig. 4, which is omitted due to the large size of the associated data files. 
Some of the earthquake catalogs we collected cannot be shared publicly because of data access restrictions. Therefore, we include only a few example catalogs. Consequently, it is not possible to directly reproduce all of the figures from our analysis, as the scripts depend on both the intermediate data generated by the main analysis code and the raw catalog data. Nevertheless, the entire workflow can, in principle, be reproduced by first running the main_analysis_par.m script.

We are pleased to answer any questions (email: lxli@caltech.edu or lucas.linxuan.li@gmail.com).
