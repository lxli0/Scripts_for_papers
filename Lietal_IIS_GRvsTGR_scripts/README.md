This is a repository containing the code to generate the results in the paper **"Tapering of large-magnitude events in induced earthquake sequences"**, by *Linxuan Li, Kyungjae Im, and Jean-Philippe Avouac*.

We provide here the scripts used to reproduce all of our figures. However, some of the earthquake catalogs we collected cannot be shared publicly due to data access restrictions. Therefore, we only include a few example catalogs. As a result, it is not possible to directly generate all the figures from our analysis, since the scripts depend on both the intermediate data produced by the main analysis code and the raw catalog data. Nevertheless, it is in principle possible to reproduce the entire workflow by first running the main_analysis_par.m script.

We are pleased to answer any questions (email: lxli@caltech.edu or lucas.linxuan.li@gmail.com).
